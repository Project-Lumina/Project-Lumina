## Information
As mentioned earlier and in the about section, Project Lumina is the first free non-jailbreak client for Minecraft on iOS devices. It comes with a diverse mod menu, featuring over 15 modules, covering areas like hacks, combat, UI customization, and options editing. It is a collaborative open-source project, meaning the community makes updates to it rather than a team of developers.
