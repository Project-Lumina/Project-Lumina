## Information
As mentioned earlier and in the about section, Project Lumina is the first free non-jailbreak client for Minecraft on iOS devices. It comes with a diverse mod menu, featuring over 15 modules, covering areas like hacks, combat, UI customization, and options editing. It is a collaborative open-source project, meaning the community makes most updates to it rather than a team of developers.

### Disclaimer
Project Lumina, formerly known as MCPE Toolbox for iOS, is created for educational purposes and is recommended for use in single-player worlds. It is explicitly not intended to provide unfair advantages to players, particularly in multiplayer settings. Users engaging in multiplayer activities with the client are expected to do so responsibly. Failure to use Project Lumina in the intended way may result in consequences, such as bans from the servers where the cheats were applied.
